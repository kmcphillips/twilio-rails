# Twilio Rails

[![RSpec Tests](https://github.com/kmcphillips/twilio-rails/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/kmcphillips/twilio-rails/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The `twilio-rails` gem is an opinionated Rails engine and a framework for building complex, realtime, stateful phone interactions in Rails without needing to directly interact with the Twilio API or use TwiML. It is not a replacement for the [`twilio-ruby` gem](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-ruby), but is rather built on top of it.

The most powerful ability of this engine is to build phone trees (think of calling customer service and pressing 2 for account information or whatever) using a simple Ruby DSL.

## Quick start TL;DR

TODO



## Getting started

### Installation

Add this line to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "twilio-rails"
```

After running `bundle`, run the installer:

```sh
bin/rails generate twilio:rails:install
```

There is now a pending migration to create the tables needed for the framework. But before running `bin/rails db:migrate` the initializer needs to be configured with values from your Twilio account.


### Twilio configuration

Twilio will provide the phone number(s) you will use for your phone trees and SMS responders. Begin by creating an account and logging in at [https://console.twilio.com](https://console.twilio.com).

You can get instructions on configuring Twilio for your app by running:

```sh
bin/rails twilio:rails:config
```

From the dashboard, find the "Account SID" and "Auth token" and copy them into the `config/initializers/twilio_rails.rb` file. Or better yet, use an environment variable or a secrets file to store them.

Next, go to "Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Buy a Number" and buy a phone number. Enter this number into the `config/initializers/twilio_rails.rb` file as well as the `default_phone_number` option.


### Local development

Twilio requires a publicly accessible URL to make requests to. When developing locally a tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) can expose a local dev server via a publicly available SSL URL. Ngrok has a free tier and is easy to use. [See the install instructions for more information](https://ngrok.com/download). Other forwarding services exist and will work fine as well.

Whatever service, the public URL must be set in the `config/initializers/twilio_rails.rb` file as the `config.host` value. If this value is not set it will be inferred from `action_controller.default_url_options` if possible. Rails also requires the host to be added to the `config.hosts` list in `application.rb` or `development.rb`.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.hosts << "my-ngrok-url.ngrok.io"
```


### Example app

An example Rails app demonstrating the framework is available at [`twilio-rails-example`](https://github.com/kmcphillips/twilio-rails-example). It can be run locally with some minimal configuration, or can be reached as a working Twilio app by calling:

## How it works

This gem provides the persistence layer, lifecycle management and events, and a DSL for building phone trees and SMS responders. Twilio provides a [`twilio-ruby` gem](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-ruby) for their API and [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml) to define complex phone and SMS interactions. This gem uses both of these but the user does not need to understand or use either of them directly.

### Models

After running the install generator, it generates five Active Record models with the following relationships:

![model classes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84159/217126823-36a8a8c5-3b4e-4d76-987b-f4c237d6ae2e.png)

The `PhoneCaller` is the individual making a phone call, uniquely identified by their phone number.

The `PhoneCall` is the record of a single phone call, either inbound or outbound. It is mutable and lifecycle callbacks handle state changes such as call length, call status, if it was answered or not, answering machine detection, etc.. Every phone call is mapped to exactly one phone tree, discussed in detail below, which directs using ruby how each interaction with the caller is handled.

A phone call has many `Response` records. Each interaction with the caller is a response, which is also mutable and lifecycle managed. Responses are stored in order and are the log of every step of the phone call. Responses contain user input, if any was asked for, such as digit presses, voice input, and transcriptions.

An `SMSConversation` is the record of a series of SMS messages exchanged with a phone caller. Each conversation has many `Message` records, flagged as either inbound or outbound. The full contents of the messages are stored in in the DB. Messages are handled based on responders, discussed in detail below.


### Phone trees

A phone tree is a subclass of [`Twilio::Rails::Phone::BaseTree`](lib/twilio/rails/phone/base_tree.rb) and provides a ruby DSL for defining how a phone call will be handled. See the documentation for full details.

Start by running the generator to create a new phone tree in `app/twilio/phone_trees/documentation_example_tree.rb`:

```sh
bin/rails generate twilio:rails:phone_tree DocumentationExampleTree
```

Regardless of inbound or outbound call, the entrypoint of a phone tree is the `greeting`:

```ruby
class DocumentationExampleTree < Twilio::Rails::Phone::BaseTree
  greeting message: "Hello!",
    prompt: :thank_you_for_calling
```

A `greeting` can provide some kind of `message:` and must provide a `prompt:`. A phone tree is a series of named `prompt`s that are jumped to by name to control the flow of the call. In this example, following the greeting control of the call moves to the `thank_you_for_calling` prompt:

```ruby
prompt :thank_you_for_calling,
  message: "Thank you for calling.",
  after: :hold_music
```

Any `message:` string as text will be read to the caller using Twilio's [Text-To-Speech voice synthesis](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/say/text-speech). Twilio allows the choice between several voices, including Amazon Polly voices. The voice can be set for the entire tree or for individual prompts.

```ruby
voice "man"

prompt :polly_demo,
  message: { say: "I am a Polly voice.", voice: "Polly.Matthew-Neural" },
  after: :hold_music
```

Any `message:` can also accept a `Hash` instead of a `String`:

* `{ say: "Hello" }` - Text-to-speech using the default or globally configured voice. Equivalent to just passing `"Hello"`.
* `{ say: "Hello", voice: "man" }` - Text-to-speech using the specified voice.
* `{ play: "https://example.com/audio.mp3" }` - Play a `wav` or `mp3` audio file from a URL.
* `{ pause: 1 }` - Pause silently for the specified number of seconds.

A `message:` can also be an `Array` which contains any number of the above hashes and strings, which will be passed to Twilio in order.

```ruby
prompt :musical_interlude,
  message: [
    { say: "Please listen to this music.", voice: "Polly.Salli" },
    { play: "https://example.com/musical_interlude.mp3" },
    { pause: 1 }
    "We hope you enjoyed this music.",
  ],
  after: :time_of_day
```

And finally, a `message:` can be a `Proc` which will be called with the previous `Response` object and can return any of the above. Nearly any part of a phone tree can be a `Proc` which can be used to make the tree dynamic and interactive.

```ruby
prompt :time_of_day,
  message: ->(response) { "The time is #{Time.now.strftime("%l:%M %p")}." },
  after: {
    prompt: :last_prompt,
    message: ->(response) { "All is well." }
  }
```

The `after:` option can be a `Hash` rather than just a symbol. If it is a hash it accepts a `prompt:` key which is the same as just passing a symbol. It also accepts a `message:` which supports all of the above options, including a `Proc`. Though in this case it will be called with the current `Response` object, not the previous one.

```ruby
prompt :last_prompt,
  after: {
    message: "Have a good day. Goodbye.",
    hangup: true
  }
```

The `after:` option can also accept a `hangup:` key which will hang up the call after the message is read. This is useful for the last prompt in a tree. The `after:` must provide either the next prompt or a hangup, not both. The entire `after:` can also be a `Proc` with the current response object.

```ruby
prompt :maybe_last_prompt,
  after: ->(response) {
    if MyServiceObject.should_hangup?(response)
      { message: "Sorry, this call must now end.", hangup: true }
    else
      :main_menu
    end
  }
```

This is starting to show how using `Proc`s a phone tree can be highly dynamic and interactive. Each `Response` is saved to the database automatically, and associated to the `PhoneCall` in order. The `Proc` can make calls into the Rails app and do any kind of complex logic to determine the next step in the call. Just be aware that raising an exception or returning an invalid value will cause Twilio to error and for the call to end. Also keep in mind that Twilio will end the call if the response takes too long.

The final key that `prompt` accepts is `gather:`. This is used to collect digits from the keypad, or speech/voice audio. A `gather:` is optional and will be inserted between the `message:` if any and the `after:`.

```ruby
prompt :rate_your_experience,
  message: "Please rate your experience on a scale of 1 to 5."
  gather: {
    type: :digits,
    timeout: 5,
    number: 1,
    interrupt: true
  },
  after: ->(response) {
    if response.integer_digits.blank?
      {
        message: "Sorry, we did not get your rating. You can enter using the number keys on your phone",
        prompt: :rate_your_experience
      }
    elsif response.integer_digits < 1 || response.integer_digits > 5
      {
        message: "Sorry, your rating must be between 1 and 5.",
        prompt: :rate_your_experience
      }
    else
      {
        message: "You have given a rating of #{ response.integer_digits }. Thank you. Goodbye.",
        hangup: true
      }
    end
  }
```

The `gather:` for `type: :digits` pauses after the message for `timeout:` number of seconds, defaulting to 5, and waits for the caller to type in `number:` number of digits, defaulting to 1. The digits, if any pressed, will be stored on the `Response` and this can be used in the `after:` to determine the next step in the call. The `interrupt:` boolean option, default `false`, dictates if pressing a digit will interrupt the message being played, or if the gather will not gather until the message has completed playing. To tie it together, the above example uses an [accessor method on `Response`](lib/twilio/rails/models/response.rb) to get the digits as an integer, and takes an action based on some basic data validation. If the response is not valid, the same prompt is repeated to the caller. If a digit is pressed before the message is finished playing, the message will stop, the digit will be stored, and move right to the `after`.

The `gather:` can also accept `type: :voice` which will record the caller's voice for `length:` number of seconds, defaulting to 10.

```ruby
prompt :record_your_feedback,
  message: "Please leave us a message with your feedback, and press the pound key when you are done.",
  gather: {
    type: :voice,
    length: 30,
    beep: true,
    transcribe: true,
    profanity_filter: true
  },
  after: {
    message: "Thank you for your feedback. Goodbye.",
    hangup: true
  }
```

The above `gather:` with `type: :voice` example will finish reading the message, play a beep, and then record the phone caller's speech for 30 seconds or until they press the `#` pound key. The phone tree will then immediately execute the `after:`, while the framework continues to handle the audio recording asynchronously. When Twilio makes it available, the audio file of the recording will be downloaded and stored as an Active Storage attachment in a `Recording` model as `response.recording`. If the `transcribe:` option is set to `true`, the voice in the recording will also attempt to be transcribed as text and stored as `response.transcription`. Importantly though, **neither are guaranteed to arrive or will arrive immediately**. In practice they both usually arrive within a few seconds, but can sometimes be blank or missing if the caller is silent or garbled. There is a cost to transcription so it can be disabled, and the `profanity_filter:` defaults to false and will just *** out any profanity in the transcription.

Finally, the `gather:` can also accept `type: :speech` which is a specialzed model designed to identify voice in realtime. It will provide the `response.transcription` field immediately, making it available in the `after:` proc or in the next prompt. But the tradeoffs are that it does not provide a recording, there is a time gap of a few seconds between prompts, and it is more expensive. See the [Twilio documentation for specifics](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/gather#speechmodel). The keys it expects match the documentation, `speech_model:`, `speech_timeout:`, `language:` (defaults to "en-US"), and `encanced:` (defaults to false).

```ruby
prompt :what_direction_should_we_go,
  message: "Which cardinal direction should we go?",
  gather: {
    type: :speech,
    language: "en-US",
    enhanced: true,
    speech_model: "numbers_and_commands",
    speech_timeout: "auto",
  },
  after: ->(response) {
    if response.transcription.blank?
      {
        message: "Sorry, we did not get your response. Please try again.",
        prompt: :what_direction_should_we_go,
      }
    elsif response.transcription_matches?("north", "south", "east", "west")
      MyCommandObject.move(response.transcription)

      {
        message: "Moving #{ response.transcription }.",
        hangup: true
      }
    else
      {
        message: "Sorry, we did not understand your response.",
        prompt: :what_direction_should_we_go,
      }
    end
  }
```

To inspect the implementation and get further detail, most of the magic happens in [`Twilio::Rails::Phone::Tree`](lib/twilio/rails/phone/tree.rb) and the operations under [`Twilio::Rails::Phone::Twiml`](app/operations/twilio/rails/phone/twiml/) where the DSL is defined and then converted inbot [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml).


### SMS responders

TODO



### Errors

All errors are subclasses of [`Twilio::Rails::Error`](lib/twilio/rails.rb). They are grouped under [`Twilio::Rails::Phone::Error`](lib/twilio/rails/phone.rb) and [`Twilio::Rails::SMS::Error`](lib/twilio/rails/sms.rb), and then further specialized from there.


## Limitations and known issues

This framework was extracted from a larger project. There are some assumptions built in that are limitations of the current implementation. Please feel free to PR improvements! But for now, known limitations are:

* Only North American phone numbers are supported, 1 plus 10 digits (`+155566677777`).
* Some North American assumptions of "day" are hidden in a couple places.
* Only production tested with MySQL and SQLite, but should work with Postgres. Assumes `utf8mb4` encoding in MySQL, but the migration does not specify it in order to support other DBs.
* Only production tested with Sidekiq, but any ActiveJob provider should work.
* There is no support for domain level events or observers. This means hooks need to be implemented using active record model callbacks, which is opaque, fragile, and confusing. In future the framework could define and trigger named events based on lifecycle.
* SMS handling is pretty simple and pattern matching based. This is not an implementation of a full chat bot. Other better frameworks exist for that. This could probably be completely rebuilt to work in a similar way where a phone number is bound to a responder by name, rather than each one implementing `handle?`.
* Generators do not generate tests, but should look at the generator `test_framework` config and produce tests or specs for the created classes.
* Not all Twilio TwiML features are supported. Many though are easy to add flags that are just passed through, and are easy to add.
  * The `gather:` should support `hints:` and some other config options.
* Some documentation is missing in:
  * Controller actions.
